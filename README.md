# NODE VIA APPLICATIOn

## Instructions

 Sup guys, be sure to use npm to install the latest version of node on your system. Also, if you are running this in a virtualbox/vagrantbox, type export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/viadb into your command line inside the vagrant box. Meteor is kinda screwy, but after that, it should be smooth sailing.
